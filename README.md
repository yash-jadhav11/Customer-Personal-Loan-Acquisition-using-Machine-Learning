# Customer Personal Loan Acquisition using Machine Learning

## Introduction:
This project focuses on exploring ways for a bank (Thera Bank) to convert its liability customers to personal loan customers while retaining them as depositors. The goal is to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio of converting liability customers to personal loan customers with minimal budget.

## Learning Outcomes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preparation for model training
- Training and making predictions using classification models
- Model evaluation

## Steps and Tasks:
1. *Understanding Data Attributes:*
   - Read the column description and ensure understanding of each attribute.
   
2. *Data Distribution Analysis:*
   - Study the distribution of data in each attribute and share findings.

3. *Target Column Distribution:*
   - Analyze the distribution of the target column (likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans) and provide comments.

4. *Data Splitting:*
   - Split the data into training and test sets in the ratio of 70:30, respectively.

5. *Classification Modeling:*
   - Utilize different classification models (Logistic Regression, K-NN, and Naïve Bayes) to predict the likelihood of a customer buying personal loans.

6. *Confusion Matrix:*
   - Print the confusion matrix for all the above models.
